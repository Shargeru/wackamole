Hello, welcome to my first published project!

- What do I make here?
So I made a simple website where you can hit a mole to get points. Yes, that is very simple, I guess.

- What programming language should I use?
So mainly here, I use HTML, CSS, and Java Script.

But don't worry, I will try to make this web better soon.
